TODO list for gbsplay.


### bugs

( )  `./configure --enable-something` prints no error like
     "'something' does not exist".

( )  configure script does not print "shared lib enabled"

( )  make install/uninstall miss shared library

### unspecified: (bits'n'ideas)

( )  gbsplay: add repeat mode for module
     (after the last subsong subsong 1 starts over)

( )  gbsplay: add restart subsong keyboard command

( )  gbsplay: make refresh_delay a commandline argument

( )  gbsplay: toggle display of channel/volume
     (about 1fps on my Win2k/Cygwin --> simply want to deactivate it.
      display of time is enough)

( )  gbsplay: use ncurses for status display and keyboard input

( )  gbsinfo: add --help option

### version 0.0.6:

( )  set up feature list for 0.0.6 release

(X)  generate a dynamic library that is used by gbsplay, gbsinfo and gbsxmms
     (configure --enable-sharedlibgbs)
     (at least install/uninstall buggy and thus this feature has not
      been announced in the 0.0.5 release!)

(X)  Fix make install, uninstall and clean on Cygwin:
     All executables have .exe suffix.
