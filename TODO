TODO list for gbsplay.


### bugs



### unspecified: (bits'n'ideas)

( )  add info about GBS formats 1 and 2

( )  generate 1 dynamic library that is used by gbsplay, gbsinfo and gbsxmms



### version 0.0.2:

( )  set up feature list for 0.0.2 release

( )  pump up man page version number on release!

(X)  xmms-gbs bugfix:
     forwarding though subsongs works
     when jumping back a subsong, the songchange is ok, but the time
     and position display always jump straight to the beginning

( )  make gbsinfo output more script friendly
     (perhaps via with commandline switch)

( )  gbsplay: add fadeout option to automatic songchange

( )  gbsplay: add shuffle mode for subsongs
     (play every subsong once)

( )  gbsplay: add random mode for subsongs
     (single subsongs can be played more than once)

( )  gbsplay: add repeat mode for module
     (after the last subsong subsong 1 starts over)

( )  gbsplay: stop at a given subsong
     ("gbsplay $file 3 3" will play only song 3 and then stop)
