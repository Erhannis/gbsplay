TODO list for gbsplay.


### bugs

( )  gbsplay: screen scrolls up one line on resume

( )  XMMS reports error on exit when gbsxmms was loaded:
     Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkobject.c: line 1179 (gtk_object_unref): assertion `object->ref_count > 0' failed.

### unspecified: (bits'n'ideas)

( )  generate a dynamic library that is used by gbsplay, gbsinfo and gbsxmms

( )  gbsplay: add repeat mode for module
     (after the last subsong subsong 1 starts over)

( )  gbsplay: add restart subsong keyboard command

( )  gbsplay: make refresh_delay a commandline argument

( )  gbsplay: toggle display of channel/volume
     (about 1fps on my Win2k/Cygwin --> simply want to deactivate it.
      display of time is enough)

( )  gbsplay: use ncurses for status display and keyboard input

( )  gbsinfo: add --help option

### version 0.0.4:

( )  set up feature list for 0.0.4 release

(X)  make gbsinfo output *really* script friendly

(X)  configure: support for stripped-down versions of mktemp

(X)  gbsplay/gbshw: improved buffer handling

(X)  gbsplay: allow -1 as subsong (default)

(X)  clean up build process (rebuild only changed files)

(X)  gettext support

(X)  gbs2ogg.sh: fix script (wrong path to gbsinfo)

(X)  build process: fixes for non-GNU find

(X)  gbsxmms: now works on FreeBSD

(X)  gbsplay: changed -z and -Z description.  shuffled lists are
     reproducible over playlist boundaries.
