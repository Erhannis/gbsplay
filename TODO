TODO list for gbsplay.


### bugs

( )  XMMS Plugin:
     forwarding though subsongs works
     when jumping back a subsong, the songchange is ok, but the time
     and position display always jump straight to the beginning


### unspecified: (bits'n'ideas)

( )  make gbsinfo output more script friendly
     (perhaps via with commandline switch)
( )  add info about GBS formats 1 and 2
( )  add random and shuffle mode (as "described" by mpg123) for subsongs
( )  generate 1 dynamic library that is used by gbsplay, gbsinfo and gbsxmms
( )  add fadeout option to automatic songchange


### version 0.0.2:

( )  set up feature list for 0.0.2 release
( )  pump up man page version number on release!
