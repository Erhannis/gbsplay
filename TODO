TODO list for gbsplay.


### bugs

( )  gbsplay: screen scrolls up one line on resume

( )  XMMS reports error on exit when gbsxmms was loaded:
     Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkobject.c: line 1179 (gtk_object_unref): assertion `object->ref_count > 0' failed.

### unspecified: (bits'n'ideas)

( )  generate a dynamic library that is used by gbsplay, gbsinfo and gbsxmms

( )  gbsplay: add repeat mode for module
     (after the last subsong subsong 1 starts over)

( )  gbsplay: add restart subsong keyboard command

( )  gbsplay: make refresh_delay a commandline argument

( )  gbsplay: toggle display of channel/volume
     (about 1fps on my Win2k/Cygwin --> simply want to deactivate it.
      display of time is enough)

( )  gbsplay: use ncurses for status display and keyboard input

( )  gbsinfo: add --help option

### version 0.0.5:

( )  set up feature list for 0.0.5 release
