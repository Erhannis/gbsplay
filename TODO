( )  pump up man page version number on release!

(X)  BUGFIX xmms-gbs:
     forwarding though subsongs works
     when jumping back a subsong, the songchange is ok, but the time

     (play every subsong once)

     (single subsongs can be played more than once)

( )  gbsplay: add repeat mode for module
     (after the last subsong subsong 1 starts over)

(X)  gbsplay: stop at a given subsong
     ("gbsplay $file 3 3" will play only song 3 and then stop)
