desc: |-
  do you know of gbs colletions, from where to get more gbs music files?
  
  i found one at www.chiptune.com which has mgb files, which have this
  magic inside: GameBoy Music Module

    mgb is the file format of the Paragon 5 Gameboy Tracker (http://www.nullsleep.com/programs/p5_tracker.zip)
    from Paragon5 (http://www.paragon5.com/).  A WinAmp plugin is here: http://support.xmplay.com/file_comment.php?id=24
    
    Support for the mgb format would require writing a sound player routine for the GameBoy that plays the mgb files.
    If this is done, gbsplay should be able to play the resulting file (player and music).
    
    I think that Paragon5 already has done this so that mgb files can be played on a real GameBoy, but I'm not sure.
    Without access to their player, everything would have to be reverse engineered.
