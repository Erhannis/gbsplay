This program emulates the sound hardware of the Nintendo Gameboy.  It
is able to play the sounds from a Gameboy module dump (.GBS format)
over /dev/dsp.

gbsplay is compatible to GBSv1.  It uses a backwards compatible extension
to store additional information in the file.  The gbsplay package contains
the following parts:

 * gbsplay:     a console player
 * gbsinfo:     displays information about a gbs file
 * gbsxmms.so:  an .GBS input plugin for XMMS
