gbsplay HISTORY


2004/04/13  -  0.0.6-rc2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Known gotchas:

- Building the NAS output plugin does not always work.  On FreeBSD,
  Cygwin and Debian Woody some additional compile and link parameters
  needed which are not auto-configured yet.  Thus the nas plugin is
  not enabled by default.
- Some compile warnings on Cygwin.  Nothing serious.

Bugfixes:

- fix make errors on CygWin
- fix "make dist" on FreeBSD
- fix path errors in configure script

Enhancements:

- code optimizations (using regparm where available)

- include example song "Nightmode" by Laxity

- gbsplay:
  - include a NAS driver
  - repeat mode for infinite playmode
  - set screen refresh rate (refresh_delay)
  - include a sound output plugin architecture

- gbsinfo:
  - add --help option

- build process:
  - print error on non-existing configure options
  - print additional diagnostic messages during configure
  - enable building of a shared library
