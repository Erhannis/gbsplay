gbsplay INSTALL instructions


### BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

Run "make".  This should autoconfigure and build all files.  If you
have GTK2 and XMMS development files installed, the XMMS library will
also be built.

Run "make install" (as root) to install everything to your system.
Run "make uninstall" (as root) to remove it afterwards.



### CUSTOMIZING THE INSTALLATION TARGET

To change the installation target, set a prefix:

$ make install prefix=/tmp/GBSPLAY

Remember to use the same prefix on uninstall!



### CUSTOMIZING THE XMMS PLUGIN PATH

Installing the XMMS plugin to another directory is a bit tricky :-)
Upon configure, the XMMS plugin target path is detected by running
`xmms-config --input-plugin-dir`.  You can not change this path!
But you can prepend it with another path.  Use DESTDIR= for this.

Example:

$ make install prefix=/tmp/GBSPLAY/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/GBSPLAY

This will install to /tmp/GBSPLAY/usr/(bin|man|share/doc) and put the
XMMS plugin to /tmp/GBSPLAY/$(xmms-config --input-plugin-dir).

This is probably what you want to do if you plan to
"install everything under /tmp/GBSPLAY".
